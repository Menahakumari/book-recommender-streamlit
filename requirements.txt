âœ… How to Create It
You have 2 easy options:

ðŸ”¸ Option 1: Create it manually
Open Notepad (or any text editor)

Paste the above lines exactly

Save the file as:

Copy
Edit
requirements.txt
Make sure the extension is .txt and not .txt.txt.

ðŸ”¸ Option 2: Create it with Python (Colab or Jupyter)
If you're using Colab, run this cell:

python
Copy
Edit
with open("requirements.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("streamlit\npandas\nscikit-learn\nfuzzywuzzy\npython-Levenshtein\n")
It will create the file in your working directory â€” ready to download or upload to GitHub.

Do you want me to also generate a .zip file containing:

âœ… streamlit_app.py

âœ… books.csv (if you upload it)

âœ… requirements.txt
